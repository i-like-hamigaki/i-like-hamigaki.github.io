<p class="text-right">Kuang Si Waterfall</p>ass
Kuang Si Waterfall is must place to vist when you visit Luang Prabang.
The place is known as the beautiful water, and you can find that lots people enjoy swimg in a basin of the waterfall.

litte bit far from town, you need to take a car to go there (around 30 km from the town).
i went to there in August, rainy season. So actually i cound't see the beautiful water like i saw photos from Internet.
however i enjoyed discovering the place. i spent 3 hours to walk around.

> **町歩きが楽しい**

<img src="/assets/images/IMGP1950A.JPG" class="align-center" alt="">
ルアンパバーンの町の朝は早く、朝の五時半、日が昇り始めたころ、町の中心で托鉢を見学することができる。
托鉢とは、お坊さんにご飯を寄付することで、もちろん観光客でも寄付が可能だ。

仏教というものがラオスの人々にとって、如何に重要かを感じ取ることができる。
お坊さんが並ぶ、独自の光景は早起きしてでも一見の価値あり。

托鉢は30分程度で終わってしまいます。

もしもある行くのに疲れたら、マッサージに行くのも良い。
町の中にはたくさんのマッサージ屋さんがある。
1 Hour Foot Massage for around 60000 kip〜.

> **Delicious foods**

<p class="text-right">Khao Piak Sen</p>
Khao Piak Sen is a local food from Laos. It is my best food in Laos.
The noodles are chewy with pork or chiken bone soup. I recommend it!

<p class="text-right">Lao Omelet</p>
I knew this omlet from Japanese website. Some Japanese recommned it.
The taste is good and the atomsphere of the restraunt is also good.
but in the restraunt, there are many ants at tables because the restraunt is located outside.
if you don't care about this. you must enjoy this food. The storekeeper is friendly.

> **conclusion**

This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.

Left Aligned
This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it’s views. It’s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.

Center Aligned
This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.

Right Aligned
This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it’s views. It’s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it’s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.

Justify Aligned
This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it’s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.
